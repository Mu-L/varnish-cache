	Usage: $SCRIPT [-b <rev>] [-g <rev>] [-i] [-j <jobs>] [<file>]
	       $SCRIPT -h

	Automatically look for the change that introduced a regression with
	the help of a test case.

	Available options:
	-h         : show this help and exit
	-b <rev>   : bad revision (defaults to HEAD)
	-g <rev>   : good revision (defaults to latest tag before bad)
	-i         : inverted mode, look for a bug fix instead
	-j <jobs>  : number of jobs for make invocations (defaults to 8)

	Environment variables:

	CONFIGURE_OPTS : additional options for the configure script
	MAKE_OPTS      : additional options for make(1) executions

	When <file> is empty or missing, bisect.vtc is expected to be found
	at the root of the git repository. The current source tree is used
	and VPATH setups are not supported.

	The -i option inverses the bisection behavior: the test case is now
	expected to fail on the good revision and pass on the bad revision.
	This is useful to track a bug that was fixed without being noticed.

	This script is expected to run from the root of the git repository
	as well.
